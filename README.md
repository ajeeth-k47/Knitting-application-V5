# Knitting-application-V5

## Application Details

- Application name: Knitting Management Application
- Software Development Model: AGILE MODEL
- Domain: Textile
#### Tech Stack 
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
- Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose.
- Database:  MongoDB (Mongo Atlas).


## Development Process Involved

### Requirement Gathering
I visited the client's site to understand the knitting process, created a process flow model for better understanding of the entire process, and gathered initial user requirements. Throughout demos and client feedback, I collected subsequent requirements and implemented new features, culminating in the development of the complete application with all core features.

### Planning
Identified the technology stack for application development and estimated the anticipated time required for completion.

### Design and Development
After designing the prototype of the application based on the knitting process flow model and obtaining client verification, I initiated the implementation phase. I used MVC pattern, I utilized npm, Node, and ExpressJS on the server side, for the frontend I used HTML,CSS,EJS,JavaScript and Bootstrap Framework. To establish a connection between the server-side application and the MongoAtlas cloud server, I leveraged the Mongoose framework, employing it for CRUD operations and schema model creation.

### Deployment, Test, Integration and DEMO.

Following the implementation of each feature according to user requirements, I proceeded to deploy and thoroughly test the code to identify and address potential bugs. Utilizing Postman, I conducted API testing and seamlessly integrated my implementation onto the Heroku cloud server. Subsequently, I conducted a demonstration with the client, gathered valuable feedback, and discussed any new requirements for additional features. This iterative development process continued until the final application was achieved, encompassing all desired features.
